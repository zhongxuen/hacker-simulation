### Quiz

<Quiz
  question="Your team finds an open door into a computer that isn't on the scope letter. What do you do?"
  options={[
    { text: "Test it quickly, since it's already open", explanation: "Open or not, it isn't yours to test. Without the owner's written permission, testing it is a crime." },
    { text: "Stop, write it down, and ask the client", correct: true, explanation: "That's what professionals do: note it, don't touch it, and ask the owner whether they want it added to the scope." },
    { text: "Tell a friend so they can have a look", explanation: "That hands someone else a way in without permission. Anything you find stays between the team and the client." },
