 * competing for the cores, that first load can take longer than waitFor's one-second budget, which
 * fails the assertion below for a reason that has nothing to do with the component.
 *
 * Loading it here turns that into something the test awaits: by the time the effect asks, the
 * module registry already has it and the dynamic import resolves on a microtask.
