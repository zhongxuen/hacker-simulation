 * The mentor transcript: the learner's recent commands and what the computer showed, sent to the
 * mentor routes so Noor can speak to what they actually tried (md-files/10-ai-mentor.md, prompts
 * 10.1 and 10.4). It is the only learner text that ever leaves the browser, and only when the
 * learner asks the mentor for something: a hint, an explanation, or a look back at their run
 * (md-files/03-app-state-and-privacy.md, "Sent, but not kept").
 *
 * It is untrusted, in two directions:
 *  - Forging it only changes the learner's own answer (there is no account and nothing is stored),
 *    so it never needs authenticating.
 *  - It is always treated as data, never instructions: the prompt wraps it in a delimited block and
 *    the caps here (plus the server's body-size cap) keep it small and cheap.
 *
 * The same caps run on both sides: `buildMentorTranscript` trims client-side before sending, and the
 * request schemas trim again server-side, so the model never sees more than this regardless of what
 * a forged body contains. A hint looks at the last few commands in detail; the post-mission review
 * looks at more commands, with less of each one's output.
