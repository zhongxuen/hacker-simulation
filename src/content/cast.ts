/**
 * The story's cast: everyone who can speak in a mission's story beats, from the quick-reference
 * table in md-files/story-bible.md. Mission schemas validate every beat's `speaker` against these
 * ids, and the mission runner renders each beat with `CharacterMessage` using the name, role,
 * initials and tone here.
 *
 * Ids are stable: never rename or reuse one. The prefix states the role (`mentor-`, `teammate-`,
 * `client-`). A new character goes into the story bible first (with a names check), then here.
 * The antagonists, the Hollow Latch, never speak in a beat, so they have no id.
