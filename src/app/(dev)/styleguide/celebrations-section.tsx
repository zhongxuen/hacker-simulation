            mission complete. The reward colour (<Code>--reward</Code>) is kept for these alone.

            click, and any key skips it. Press <strong>Play again</strong> to watch one more time.

          A guided-tour pointer for first runs. The live copy dims the page around one element,
          rings it (the ring pulses twice, then holds still; under reduced motion it holds still
          from the start), and shows this card beside it. The dimming lets clicks through, focus
          moves to the card, Escape skips, and focus goes back when the tour ends. The frozen
          pictures show the card alone.
